# Task 21: Check if the user selected the option for loading data.  If so, then do the following:
        # - Use the appropriate function in the module tui to display a message to indicate that the data loading
        # operation has started.
        # - Load the data (see below).
        # - Use the appropriate function in the module tui to display a message to indicate that the data loading
        # operation has completed.
        #
        # To load the data, it is recommended that you create and call one or more separate functions that do the
        # following:
        # - Use the appropriate function in the module tui to retrieve a file path for the CSV data file.  You
        # should appropriately handle the case where this is None.
        # - Read each line from the CSV file and add it to the list 'records'. You should appropriately handle the case
        # where the file cannot be found
        # TODO: Your code here
